# About BadG

Since Google homepage is getting increasingly cluttered with fancy widgets that are not only irrelevant to the core of search but also resource-intensive for an average computer, it is no longer a qualified homepage candidate for those who emphasize on agility in search experience. Search "classic google" online and you will find a lot of people complaining about Google's indifference to suggestions of providing a vanilla search interface.

Let there be LITE.

Inspired by [Google Classic](http://google-classic.com/), I set about building a light-weighted Google Custom Search engine myself. Now comes **BadG**, which resembles classic Google search in both appearance and function. No navigation bar. No avatar. No sign-in. No social network. No instant search. No auto-completion. No preview. No ads. (Hurray!) Plain but effective. Well, **G**oogle might consider it **bad**, but it suits my needs anyway.

BadG is not associated with [Google](http://www.google.com/), except for the mere use of [Google Custom Search](http://www.google.com/cse/). BadG is and will remain non-profit. No behavioral data is collected on my part. Please be advised that BadG tends to return fewer results (free of my intervention, of course) than regular Google search.
