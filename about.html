	<h1>About BadG</h1>
	<p>
		Since Google homepage is getting increasingly cluttered with fancy widgets that are not only irrelevant to the core of search but also resource-intensive for an average computer, it is no longer a qualified homepage candidate for those who emphasize on agility in search experience. Search "classic google" online and you will find a lot of people complaining about Google's indifference to suggestions of providing a vanilla search interface. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Let there be LITE.
		<br>

		Inspired by <s>google-classic.com</s> (Obsolete!), I set about building a light-weighted Google Custom Search engine myself. Now comes <b>BadG</b>, which resembles classic Google search in both appearance and function. No navigation bar. No avatar. No sign-in. No social network. No instant search. No auto-completion. No preview. No ads. (Hurray!) Plain but effective. Well, <b>G</b>oogle might consider it <b>bad</b>, but it suits my needs anyway.

		BadG is not associated with <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, except for the mere use of <a href="https://www.google.com/cse/">Google Custom Search</a>. BadG is and will remain non-profit. No behavioral data is collected on my part. Please be advised that BadG tends to return fewer results (free of my intervention, of course) than regular Google search.
